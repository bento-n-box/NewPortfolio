	<p>A television series for Rocky Mountain PBS. We were tasked with developing brand, motion, and the website. We began with the concept of building a raw and unadulterated setting to combat the growing distance between the performer and the audience. I was a lead in contstruction of this brand identity, motion creation and web development.</p>
