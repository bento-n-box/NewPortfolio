	<p>This is an animation I made for a client as freelance work. I felt that due to the complexity of the message, kenetic typography paired with iconography would be most succesful. I soon realized that the bulk of my work wasn't going to be about creating an animation but rather helping the client simplify the message behind his service into a short video. </p>
