				<p>Playing with technology is the root of what I do. By constantly experimenting with technology, I keep a fresh perspective on the new brave new world of electronics, applications, and gadgets. The discovery of web innovation like parallax scrolling, tapping in to the Iphones accelerometer, or making interactive visualizations from hacking a Kinect all are possible from individuals who explored the world of code, not because they sat in a room with a piece of paper and a pencil.</p>

				<p>I'm a technical creative and being able to ideate is a strong foundation of what I do. I thrive in a space where I'm able to come up with ideas, interactions, and new types of executions. I'm able to apply my strengths in development and new technology to the creative side.</p>					</div>

			<p>Sure coming up with big ideas and playing with tech toys is fun but when it comes to development, i'm a process driven, standards implementing, code junkie. There's nothing I like more than to sip on Lattes, jam out to the Tron soundtrack, and crank out code.</p><p> I have been part of large collaborative development teams where seem-less integration, code standards, and browser optimization are key.</p>
